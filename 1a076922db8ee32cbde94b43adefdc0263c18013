      "message": "At present, MACCHIATObin is the smallest resource-constrained device deployed in SEBA. The hardware configuration of this board is: 16GRAM, 32Gflash, quad-core;\nAfter deploying k8s and calico only, MACCHIATObin system memory is about 920M temporarily, so I think that the minimum memory should be greater than 1G.also need more storage space to store docker imagesï¼›\n\n\nThe following information is also available for your reference;\nI used two MACCHIATObins to form a cluster to run seba; and observe the memory usage, one device occupies 5.5G of memory and the other occupies 9.9G;  \nOf course, if there are more nodes to join, the hardware requirements for a single node will be reduced;",
