Thie folder contains installation scripts and other resources for testing SEBA.
For now we rely on virtualized PON and OLT software, such as BBSim and PONSim.

Each folder/testing method should contain an install.sh and test.sh scripts
respectively.

The testing phase consists of two steps:
1. Installing the PON software (for now either bbsim or ponsim). This can be
done by running the corresponding install.sh directly on the K8S master.

2. Running the actual SIAB tests. In upstream opencord.org the SIAB tests are
run on a single machine (hence the term SEBA-in-a-Box), directly on the
machine. In contrast, the iec project aims to be able to run the SIAB tests
from a different machine, in order to not pollute the environment with
testing framework. To achieve this, it is also necessary to create a running
environment and this is done using a simple Docker container which contains
all the necessary tools for running cord-tester SIAB tests. Take a look at
src/usecases/seba_on_arm/docker/build/cord-tester/build-cord-tester.arm
script for details on this image.
Note that for runing test.sh, it is necessary to obtain the Kubernetes config
(e.g. /root/.kube/) and place it in a convenient location. This will then be
passed to the docker container. Of course, the container must also have
access to the Kubernetes cluster.
