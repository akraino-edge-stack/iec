This is a set of Openstack Heat templates which creates a simple topology of
virtual machines to be used to deploy Kubernetes and Calico.

It consists of one master VM and a configurable number of slave VMs, 2 by
default.

The clusters configures itself automatically and installs the base IEC platform
together with the needed resources for Helm. SEBA will have to be installed
manually afterwards.

See the main control.sh script to start/stop the set of stacks and various
run-time options, like DPDK support.

Also look at net.yaml for the network configurations. By default, the cluster
will use 10.111.0.0/12 as the service cidr.
